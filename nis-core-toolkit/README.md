# NDT: NIS Developer Toolkit

The NIS Developer Toolkit (NDT) is the foundation of the `NIS-TOOLKIT-SUIT`. It provides the tools for system architects and engineers to build, manage, and deploy intelligent multi-agent systems.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

-   **`init` Command:** A powerful scaffolding tool for creating new, best-practices NIS projects from scratch.
-   **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** A suite of tools for coordinating complex systems of agents.
-   **Deployment & Monitoring:** Production-ready infrastructure for deploying and monitoring your systems.
-   **`integration_connector.py`:** An intelligent module for integrating the NIS Protocol into existing projects.

##  Quick Start: Create a New NIS Project

The NDT's `init` command is the recommended way to start any new NIS implementation. It creates a complete, ready-to-code project structure that is fully aligned with the official NIS Protocol.

```bash
# Run from the NIS-TOOLKIT-SUIT root directory
python nis-core-toolkit/cli/main.py init my-new-nis-project
```

This will create a new directory, `my-new-nis-project`, with everything you need to get started.
